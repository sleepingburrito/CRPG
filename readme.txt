CRPG was a car game I made for fun. It never got past what shown in the video. It has arcade top-down car physics with drifting.

WASD to move, S is reverse and brakes.
Holding Space is handbrake and is used for drifting.

From what I remember all it has is basic car physics with static and dynamic (with other cars) collision. The wold has basic tile support with layered tiles and animated tiles.  

The car sprite is mine but the rest of the graphics are test and of unknown origin. The games uses SDL for everything and outside of it all the code is mine and is licenses under MIT.
